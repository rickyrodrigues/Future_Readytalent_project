# Placement Platform
my project for future ready talent internship
This project proposes to create a centralized platform that will provide students with information about companies and job openings, a fair and transparent placement process, and a platform to upskill. The platform will also allow administrators to manage different types of users, authorize users based on their roles, and track the progress of the placement process.

Problem:-
The current placement process at many colleges is inefficient and opaque. Students often have to spend a lot of time and effort searching for jobs, and they may not be aware of all the opportunities that are available to them.

Solution:-
The proposed platform will address these problems by providing students with a single place to find information about companies and job openings. The platform will also be transparent, so that students will know exactly how the placement process works and how they can improve their chances of getting a job.

Benefits:-
The platform will have a number of benefits for students, including:

Increased access to job opportunities
Improved transparency in the placement process
Increased opportunities for upskilling
Reduced time and effort spent searching for jobs


Technical Details:-
The platform uses 2 az virtual machines, a load balancer, and Azure DNS, .tech domain name from the github student dev pack. The virtual machines will make use of shared disk.

Conclusion:-
The proposed platform is a valuable tool that will help students to find jobs and improve their career prospects. The platform is technically feasible and will have a number of benefits for students and the college.
